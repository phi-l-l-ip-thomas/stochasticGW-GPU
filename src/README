# INSTALLING AND RUNNING StochasticGW (version 1).

# Say you have installed (tar -xzvf sgw-v1.0.tgz ) the stochasticGW code in your main direcotry.  
# The code is then in ~/sgw-v1.0
# Then write:

     cd ~/sgw-v1.0

# Go to the src
    
    cd src

# Within src, change the compiler options in makefile to your liking. At present they are:
  FCMPI   = mpif90        
  MPIFLG  = -DMPI -O3
  FFTFLG  = -lfftw3

# exit makefile, and activate it
  
    make

# Make sure sgw.x has been created
  
    ls -l sgw.x

# Now you are ready to implement the code. 
# Then, say you want to run it in ~/mygwrun .  Go there, and copy
#    the H2 example input, the executable, and pseudopotentials to the present directory.

   mkdir ~/mygwrun
   cd ~/mygwrun
   cp ~/sgw-v1.0/examples/H2/* .
   cp ~/sgw-v1.0/src/sgw.x  .
   cp -r ~/sgw-v1.0/PP/ .

# At this point, your mygwrun directory should contain the following:

  cnt.ini  counter.inp  INPUT  log_h2example  PP random.inp  sgw.x   wf.txt 

# where PP is a directory (with pseudpotentials).  
# All these files are inputs except for log_h2example.

# To run the H2 example (from the Tutorial) on, say, 30 cores, write

  mpirun -n 30 ./sgw.x >& log &

# The output of log should match that of log_h2example.  

# After the H2 test is finished, you can do any run.  
# Specifically:
# 1) Change INPUT as needed -- especially make sure that you keep ntddft to be between 4 and 30
#                             and change if deisred gamma from 0.06 to, say, 0.04
#
# 2) Change the nuclear coordinatres (cnt.ini) 
#
# 3) And bring your own wf.txt (or better yet, wf.bin ) file that contains the occupied
#  dft energies and functions.  
#
# 4) And remember to include in PP any pseduopotential you need.
